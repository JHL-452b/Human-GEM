1. First  make sure you have the DepMap data - we currently use DepMap version 2021Q3. You need to go to the downloads section at
https://depmap.org/portal/download/all/ , select 2021Q3.
Download and place the files Achilles_gene_effect.csv and CCLE_expression_full.csv in the Human-GEM/code/DepMapGeneEss/data folder.
2. Run the R script ConvertGeneEssInputData.R. Note that you need to adjust the folder - R is hopeless when it comes to 
relative paths from the file - the information just doesn't exist. This will generate the file DepMap_tpm_gene_symbols.txt
3. Run PrepDepMapData.m - you may have to modify the folder here as well. This will take an hour or so and generates the files
arrayDataDepMap.mat and prepDataGeneSymbols.mat.
4. Create a folder on the cluster with a suitable name, for example "GeneEssDepMap". Within that folder, create a folder named "components".
Copy RAVEN, COBRA, and Human-GEM to components, they need to reside under those exact names, because those and underlying folders will be
added to the matlab path. Make sure the Human-GEM folder Human-GEM/code/DepMapGeneEss/data is copied as well with
the files that we generated above.
5. Go back to your top folder ("GeneEssDepMap"). Create a folder DepMapRuns. Copy the files run_gen_depmap_models.sh, 
run_evaless_depmap.sh, generate_DepMap_models_ftINIT_Cluster.m, and getTaskEssentialGenesCluster.m to that folder. Also create a folder 
called "logs" in that folder.
6. Make sure you are in the DepMapRuns folder. First, generate the models using the following line (also available in the .sh script):
sbatch -o logs/run_gen_depmap_models-%A-%a.log --array=1-40 run_gen_depmap_models.sh
It may be needed to init cobra and init RAVEN (SetRavenSolver etc.). TODO: Describe this here.
7. Run sbatch -o logs/run_evaless_depmap-%A-%a.log --array=1-40 run_evaless_depmap.sh after the model generation has completed
8. Download all produced files to the data folder on your computer. These are found in components/Human-GEM/code/DepMapGeneEss/data
9. Run evaluateDepMapEssentialityPredictions.m. Note that you may need to change the folder in the file and that there are some things in 
the file that need to be modified to match what you want to do. The file currently only gets stats for one model version, but can easily be expanded
to take in data from more model versions, although these also need to be processed as above as well.
10. Run PlotGeneEss.R in R to make a violin plot of MCC for each model. The code needs some modification to fix paths and number of models.
