# Model curation data

This directory contains curation-related data files used for making changes to the Human-GEM model. These model curation data files help to improve transparency of changes made to the model.

- #241: `rhea_reaction_association.tsv` includes Rhea reaction ids that are associated with Human-GEM reactions by equation mapping method and/or via UniProt id.
- `metabolite_name_synonyms.tsv` stores mapped synonymous metabolite names used in Human-GEM and other databases.
- `Swissprot_compartments.tsv`: Subcellular location annotations extracted from SwissProt on 2022-11-15.
- `CellAtlasCompartments_science_2017.tsv`: Experimentally [validated](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aal3321) subcellular location information downloaded from [Cell Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/search/has_protein_data_in%3ACell).
